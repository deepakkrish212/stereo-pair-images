# Image Stereo-Pairs

## Problem we are trying to solve

**Project Description** - "*Create a software system that produces an image stereo-pair from a single, ortho-corrected image and a height (depth) field with identical sample spacing.  Ortho-corrected satellite imagery and the corresponding pixel-for-pixel height fields are readily available and are used as inputs to scientific models.  We seek a process that will create an image stereo-pair for visualization purposes, utilizing the two readily available sources above.  We are interested in software to both create and validate the process.*"

We - Abemelech, Deepak, Sofonias, and Soobin (ADSS) - are planning on creating an interface for users to input *Ortho-corrected satellite imagery* with depth field data and output stereo-pair images. For this purpose, we are planning on creating a website powered by Nextjs.
